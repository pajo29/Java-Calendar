# Java-Calendar
Can be just added as a package and used as a borderPane. You can either change that, or add the existing borderPane to the Scene.
Year span from 2000-2050. Can be changed in for loop. 
# If you go below 1998, change the emptyDate in Week.java to something before.

To use it. Import the package, and use CalendarScene.getInstance();
